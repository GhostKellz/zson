# ZSON – ARCHITECTURE

This is a placeholder ARCHITECTURE.md for the **zson** project so you can download and drop it into your repo.

You can overwrite this file later with a deeper architecture spec.

- Core: Zig-based parser, encoder, and decoder
- Layers: `zson-core` (syntax + AST), `zson-dom` (in‑memory model), `zson-stream` (streaming read/write)
- Targets: CLI, library, and future bindings for Zig, Rust, and WebAssembly.
